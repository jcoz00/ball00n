We recommend upgrading manually if this happens.</p></block><block><p>Version 1.1 of this package improves the success rate and reliability of the bootup process on 64-bit devices, as well as correcting an issue that led to a failure to use the instrument functions of Xcode.</p><p>Version 1.2 of this package removes the software update daemon, which protects your jailbreak and actually fixes a problem where Manage Storage would for unknown reasons show a spinny and never finish :/.</p><p>Version 1.3 of this package makes the untether boot quickly more often on iOS 9.1 by making the exploit more reliable and able to retry more quickly. (Users of iOS 9.0 should not see any difference at all.)</p></block><block><p style="font-style:italic">Please also note that rebooting can surface other problems unrelated to the untether or Cydia. For example, having incompatible tweaks installed can cause problems upon rebooting.</p></block><fieldset><a href="http://en.pangu.io/"><img class="icon" src="https://cache.saurik.com/crystal/64x64/apps/web.png"><div><div><label><p>Pangu's Website</p></label></div></div></a><a href="https://twitter.com/PanguTeam"><img class="icon" src="/icon/twitter.png" alt="Twitter"><div><div><label><p>@PanguTeam on Twitter</p></label></div></div></a></fieldset><block><p>Please don't try to uninstall this package.
